# Maximizing Accessibility in Spartanburg’s Bus System 🚍

This repository contains the final project for our Mathematical Modeling course at Wofford College. The project explores how to maximize accessibility to essential services via Spartanburg’s public bus system using a custom-built model informed by real data.

## 📄 Project Overview

- **Course**: Mathematical Modeling (Spring 2025)
- **Team Members**: Townshend Gillespie, Caroline Kirk, Aidan Langston-Smith, Ryan Methot, Juan Salas
- **Community Presentation**: Spartanburg Community College & Wofford Data Walk, May 2025

We developed a model that assigns accessibility scores to bus stops based on proximity to key amenities such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and medical facilities. Our goal was to identify which stops are most effective at providing access and suggest areas for improvement.

## 🧠 Key Features of the Model

- Uses a weighted point system to evaluate proximity and importance of services within a 0.6-mile radius of bus stops
- Applies both full and simplified versions of the model across different stops
- Includes sensitivity analysis to test assumptions
- Provides visual data summaries to support decision-making

## 📌 Conclusion & Insights

- Bus stops in commercial districts like Dorman Center received high accessibility scores
- Residential areas showed significantly lower scores, indicating need for more inclusive route planning
- Approximately 20.8% of workers in Spartanburg County may benefit from improved public transportation due to limited vehicle access
